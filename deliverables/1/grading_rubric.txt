Grading Rubric for D1

* Introduction: 10% of grade

Concerns and/or difficulties listed:                 ____ / 5
  * At least one issue raised (-5 if no)

Clearly written:                                     ____ / 5
  * No typos / misspellings / etc
  * Understandable to reader (incl. clear sentence structure)

* Test Plan: 50% of grade

Must have >= 20 test cases; -7 for each missing < 20

Test cases are valid                                 ____ / 15
  * Include all elements (-2 for each missing)
    * Identifier
    * Test Case Description
    * Preconditions
    * Execution steps
    * Postconditions

Test cases include only EXPECTED
behavior, not OBSERVED behavior:                     ____ / 10
  * No "pass/fail" etc. written
  * Postconditions = what SHOULD happen, not what DOES
  * Test correct (expected) behavior

Expected behavior and execution
steps are SPECIFIC:                                  ____ / 15
  * No generalities (e.g. "enter a letter"; should be "enter X")
  * Tester could easily reproduce steps
  * -2 for each generality, or -4 if a "consistent" generality

At least three edge cases:                           ____ / 5
  * Valid edge cases and labeled
  * None labeled: -5, only one -4, only two -3
  * If not really an edge case, counts as missing an edge case
  
Clearly written:                                     ____ / 5
  * No typos, misspellings, etc. (-1 for each, up to -5)
  * Easy to understand and follow

* Traceability Matrix: 10% of grade

Each requirement & TC listed:                        ____ / 5
  * TCs actually map to requirement
  * -2 for each missing requirement or TC or invalid mapping
  
>= 1 Test case per requirement, and
exactly 1 requirement per TC:                        ____ / 5
  * No TC maps to > 1 req, each req has at least 1 TC

* Defects and Enhancements Found and Described: 35% of grade

Must be >= 3 defects! -10 for each missing one, or -25 if none

Defects are Reproducible:                            ____ / 10  
  * Specific steps to repro listed
  
Include expected/observed behavior:                  ____ / 10
  * Must include BOTH

Enhancement included:                                _____ / 10
  * Is an enhancement, not a defect
  * Is a reasonable, well-defined request

Clearly written:                                     ____ / 5
  * No typos, misspellings, etc.
  * Reader can understand issue
  * Follows proper format

# This is a MiniTest test file.  It will test the Predictor object in predictor.rb

# Minitest documentation here: http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/

# require can be used to access gems (i.e. libraries)
# Libraries tend to be used very often in Ruby programs and especially Rails projects
# Note that you can add a .rb or not

require 'minitest/autorun'

# This shows subclassing in action!  PredictorTest is a subclass of Minitest::Test
# This would be similar to:
# import Minitest.Test;
# public class PredictorTest extends Test { ... }


class PredictorTest < Minitest::Test

  # Methods that start with "test", and are in classes which are subclasses
  # of Minitest::Test, will be run as tests when you run this file.
  # Be careful - a common error is writing "tset_whatever" and that test
  # will never run!  This is one of the problems with an interpreted language
  # like Ruby.

  # Just like manual tests, we should always code up EXPECTED behavior in our
  # test cases, not OBSERVED behavior.  The execution of the test will determine
  # the observed behavior.  If expected behavior is not equal to the observed
  # behavior, we have a failure.

  # Verify that creating a Predictor is an instance of Predictor and not
  # something else.
  # Assertions are how we declare that something is correct with our code.
  # They should state the EXPECTED BEHAVIOR of the system (usually a method,
  # object, or class)
  # assert by itself checks that the following statement returns true
  # refute by itself would check that the following statement returns false

  # Very simple test - check that creating a new Predictor creates
  # a new Predictor and verifies that it is not nil.
  # nil is similar to Java's null
  # refute can be read as "assert not" - that is, refute_nil would
  # be the same as the (nonexistent) "assert_not_nil"
